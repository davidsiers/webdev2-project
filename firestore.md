We’re going to be building a basic list of items that you do CRUD to - create, read, update, delete. The feature itself is nothing special, it’s really just a skeleton that demonstrates how to do the most common operations with Angular and Firebase. The realtime database from Firebase uses NoSQL, so think of CRUD in the following terms.

We are building the items feature from the FireStarter demo app.
